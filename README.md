##Producing Deferred Rendering Images:
Please refer to line 546 of `main.cpp`. The value passed into the uniform variable `renderMode` will control the textures with which the environment is rendered. Change the value passed into the shader to change which shader is shown. `render_mode::DEFAULT` will render the environment with all shaders included. The other possible values are found in the enum object on line 62 of `main.cpp`
